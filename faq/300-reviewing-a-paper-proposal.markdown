# #201 - How do I add a comment to a paper proposal

You can add a comment to a paper proposal by clicking on the **Abbreviated Title** on the Publication Matrix. You will be redirected to the paper proposal page which will give you a section at the top used for reviewing, followed by the paper proposal details.

In the "Review Publication" section you can set the **Approval Status** along with a text box for comments.  Once you have added your comment click "Submit Review".
